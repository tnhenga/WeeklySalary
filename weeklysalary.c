Goal: Write a program to compute and display a
personâ€™s weekly salary as determined by the following expressions: If the number of
hours worked is less than or equal to 40, the person receives $8 per hour; otherwise,
the person receives $320, plus $12 for each hour worked over 40 hours. The program
should request the hours worked as input and should display the salary as output.
